# SSH Configuration for HELOC Accelerator VPS
# This file can be used with VS Code Remote-SSH extension
# 
# To use this config:
# 1. Copy this file to ~/.ssh/config (or append to existing config)
# 2. Make sure you have SSH key authentication set up
# 3. Use "heloc-accelerator" as the host name in VS Code Remote-SSH
#
# For password authentication (less secure):
# - Remove the IdentityFile line
# - VS Code will prompt for password
