# Demo Account Credentials

## Working Demo Account (Manually Created)
- **Email**: enoteware@gmail.com
- **Password**: demo123!!

This account was created manually through the Stack Auth dashboard and is confirmed to work with the login system.

## Usage

2. Enter the credentials above
3. You'll be redirected to the calculator page upon successful login

## Notes
- The programmatically created demo accounts (demo@example.com, etc.) have authentication issues
- This manually created account bypasses those issues and provides a reliable test account
- All Stack Auth features (login, logout, session management) work correctly with this account
