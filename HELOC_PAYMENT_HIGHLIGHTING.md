## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive visual highlighting system to emphasize key HELOC payment flows and benefits, making it clear to users how the HELOC acceleration strategy saves them money.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Reusable Highlight Components** (`/src/components/HighlightComponents.tsx`)

- **PaymentBadge**: Colored badges for different payment types
- **HighlightedCell**: Table cells with background colors and tooltips
- **FlowIndicator**: Visual arrows showing money flow
- **AnimatedCounter**: Smooth number animations for impact
- **HighlightLegend**: Color-coded legend for understanding

### 2. **Amortization Table with Highlighting** (`/src/components/AmortizationTable.tsx`)

- Interactive table showing month-by-month HELOC strategy
- Highlighted columns:
  - **Extra Payment** (Column R from Excel) - Orange/Secondary color
  - **HELOC Balance** - Blue highlighting
  - **Cumulative Interest** - Green for savings
- Toggle buttons to filter highlight modes:
  - All highlights
  - HELOC only
  - Savings only
- Expandable view (show all months vs summary)
- Payment flow visualization at bottom

### 3. **Side-by-Side Comparison** (`/src/components/ComparisonHighlight.tsx`)

- Visual comparison of Traditional vs HELOC strategies
- Animated counters for savings amounts
- Percentage badges showing interest reduction
- Color-coded columns (gray for traditional, coral for HELOC)
- Bottom summary bar with total savings

### 4. **Payment Flow Diagram** (`/src/components/PaymentFlowDiagram.tsx`)

- Three-step visual process:
  1. Monthly cash flow calculation
  2. HELOC acceleration strategy
  3. Accelerated payoff results
- Animated balance displays
- Clear flow indicators with arrows

### 5. **Enhanced Results Display**

- Summary cards with HELOC badges
- Integrated all highlighting components
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Mobile-responsive design

## Color Scheme

- **HELOC Benefits**: Secondary color (coral/orange) - `bg-secondary-50`, `text-secondary-700`
- **Traditional**: Gray tones - `bg-gray-50`, `text-gray-600`
- **Savings**: Green - `bg-green-50`, `text-green-700`
- **Payment Flows**: Blue - `bg-blue-50`, `text-blue-700`

## Key Payment Columns Highlighted

Matching the Excel screenshot provided:

- **Monthly Deposit** (Column J) → `discretionaryIncome`
- **Net Surplus** (Column L) → `discretionaryUsed`
- **Extra Payment to Mortgage** (Column R) → Additional principal payment
- **Total Interest Cumulative** (Column AC) → `cumulativeInterest`

## Interactive Features

1. **Highlight Toggle**: Users can filter which highlights to show
2. **Expand/Collapse**: Show summary or full amortization schedule
3. **Animated Counters**: Numbers animate when components mount
4. **Hover Tooltips**: Additional context on highlighted cells
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

## Visual Impact

The highlighting system makes it immediately clear:

- Where extra payments come from (HELOC strategy)
- How much extra is being paid each month
- The cumulative interest savings over time
- The dramatic reduction in payoff time

## Usage

All highlighting is automatically applied when viewing calculation results. The system emphasizes the HELOC benefits while maintaining readability and professional appearance suitable for a financial application.
