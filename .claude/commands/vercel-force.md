# /vercel-force

Force deploy to Vercel bypassing GitHub when builds fail due to caching or module resolution issues.

## Command Usage

```bash
npm run force-deploy
```

or

```bash
npm run vercel:force
```

## What This Command Does

### 1. Pre-deployment Validation

-  Runs local build to ensure code compiles without errors
-  Verifies all critical files exist using diagnostic script
-  Runs import validation to catch missing modules
- L Exits early if any validation fails

### 2. Clean Deployment Preparation

- =ï¿½ Removes all build caches (`.next`, `.vercel`, `node_modules/.cache`)
- =ï¿½ Performs fresh `npm ci` install for clean dependencies
- =( Builds project from scratch to ensure consistency

### 3. Direct Vercel Deployment

- =ï¿½ Deploys directly to Vercel production environment
- ï¿½ Bypasses GitHub integration completely
- =ï¿½ Uses `--force` flag to override any deployment conflicts
- <ï¿½ Targets production environment with `--prod` flag

## When to Use This Command

###  Use When:

- GitHub deployments failing with "Module not found" errors
- Build cache issues causing persistent failures
- Vercel dashboard shows stale or failed builds
- Need to deploy urgent fixes quickly
- Module resolution works locally but fails on Vercel

### L Don't Use When:

- Code has compilation errors locally
- Tests are failing
- You haven't committed your changes to git
- GitHub deployments are working normally

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools:

1. **Vercel CLI installed globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Authenticated with Vercel**:

   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Project linked to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

## Interactive Process

The script will:

1. **Ask for confirmation** before proceeding
2. **Show progress** for each step with colored output
3. **Validate everything** before attempting deployment
4. **Provide clear feedback** if anything fails
5. **Display deployment URL** when successful

## Example Output

```

## Important Warnings

### ï¿½ Out-of-Sync Risk

This deployment bypasses GitHub, which means:

- Deployed version may not match git repository
- Future GitHub deployments may conflict
- Team members may see different code than what's deployed

### = Best Practice

1. Use only when GitHub deployments fail
2. Always commit and push changes after successful deployment
3. Return to GitHub-based deployments once issues are resolved

## Troubleshooting

### "Vercel CLI not found"

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --version
```

### "Not authenticated"

```bash
vercel login
```

### "Project not linked"

```bash
vercel link
# Follow prompts to link to existing project
```

### "Build fails locally"

Fix issues first:

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run pre-deploy
```

### "Permission denied"

```bash
chmod +x scripts/force-vercel-deploy.sh
```

## Return to GitHub Deployments

After successful force deployment:

1. **Commit all changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "sync with force deployment"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify GitHub integration works** by making a small change
