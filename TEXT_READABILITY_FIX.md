# Text Readability Improvements - Aceternity Cards

## Problem Solved

Text on Aceternity cards was difficult to read against bright or complex background images.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dark Gradient Overlay

Added a permanent gradient overlay that ensures text is always readable:

```css
/* Bottom-to-top gradient overlay */
before:content-['']
before:absolute
before:inset-0
before:bg-gradient-to-t
before:from-black/70      /* Dark at bottom (70% opacity) */
before:via-black/20       /* Light in middle (20% opacity) */
before:to-transparent     /* Transparent at top */
before:z-10               /* Layer above background */
```

### 2. Enhanced Hover Effect

Additional overlay on hover for better contrast:

```css
/* Additional dark overlay on hover */
hover:after:content-['']
hover:after:absolute
hover:after:inset-0
hover:after:bg-black
hover:after:opacity-30    /* 30% dark overlay */
hover:after:z-20          /* Above gradient */
```

### 3. Improved Text Styling

- **Title**: Changed from `text-gray-50` to `text-white` with `drop-shadow-lg`
- **Description**: Changed from `text-gray-50` to `text-gray-100` with `drop-shadow-md`
- **Theme indicator**: Enhanced with `bg-black/50` and `backdrop-blur-sm`

### 4. Z-Index Layering

Proper layering ensures text is always on top:

- Background image: base layer
- Gradient overlay: `z-10`
- Hover overlay: `z-20`
- Text content: `z-50`
