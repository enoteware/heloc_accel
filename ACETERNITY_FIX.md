# Aceternity Cards - Endless Loop Fix

## Problem Solved
The original Aceternity cards were causing endless loops due to the `usePexelsImage` hook continuously fetching new images on every render.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `StableAceternityCard` Component
- **Fixed endless loops** by using a single `useEffect` that only depends on `theme`
- **Curated image pairs** - each theme has specific background and hover images from Unsplash
- **Simple state management** - uses `useState` for hover state only
- **No API dependency** - works independently of Pexels API

### 2. Theme-Specific Images
```typescript
const THEME_IMAGES = {
  home: {
    background: "beautiful house exterior",
    hover: "modern interior"
  },
  money: {
    background: "financial planning desk", 
    hover: "money/charts"
  },
  // ... etc
}
```

### 3. Updated Home Page
- Replaced problematic `MoneyAceternityCard` with `StableMoneyCard`
- Replaced problematic `PlanningAceternityCard` with `StablePlanningCard`  
- Replaced problematic `SuccessAceternityCard` with `StableSuccessCard`

### 4. Demo Page Enhancement
- Shows both **Stable Cards** (no loops) and **Dynamic Pexels Cards** (live API)
- Clear labeling to explain the difference
- Users can choose based on their needs

## Components Available

### Stable (Recommended for Production)
```tsx
import { 
  StableMoneyCard, 
  StablePlanningCard, 
  StableSuccessCard,
  StableHomeCard,
  StableFamilyCard 
} from '@/components/design-system'

// Usage - no props needed, just works
<StableMoneyCard />
<StablePlanningCard title="Custom Title" />
```

### Dynamic (For Live Content)
```tsx
import { 
  MoneyAceternityCard, 
  PlanningAceternityCard, 
  SuccessAceternityCard 
} from '@/components/design-system'

// Usage - fetches live images from Pexels
<MoneyAceternityCard />
```

## Key Benefits
- ✅ **No more endless loops**
- ✅ **Faster loading** (no API calls for stable cards)
- ✅ **Predictable behavior** 
- ✅ **Beautiful hover effects** still work
- ✅ **Both options available** - stable and dynamic

## Current Status
- Home page now uses stable cards
- Demo page shows both versions
- No performance issues
- All hover effects working properly
