## Example Implementation Scenario

**Client Profile:**

- Monthly Income: $8,000 gross, $6,000 net
- Monthly Expenses: $4,000
- Mortgage: $300,000 balance, 4% rate, 30-year term
- HELOC: $50,000 limit, 4.5% rate

**Budgeting Calculation:**

- Discretionary Income: $6,000 - $4,000 = $2,000
- Recommended Principal Payment: $2,000 Ã— 3 = $6,000
- Traditional Payoff: 30 years
- With Budgeting: ~20 years (10 years saved)
- Interest Savings: ~$125,000

**Scenario Modeling:**

- Emergency expense (+$1,000/month for 6 months): Adjust to $3,000 principal payment
- Annual raise (+$500/month starting month 13): Increase to $7,500 principal payment
- Impact Analysis: Updated payoff timeline and savings calculations

## Next Steps
